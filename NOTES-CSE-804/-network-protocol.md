## Communication Protocols

*   **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP):**
    > A communication protocol that defines how web browser and server should communicate with each other (e.g., formatting data, transmitting data).

*   **File Transfer Protocol (FTP):**
    > FTP is a set of rules for transferring files between computers over the internet.

*   **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):**
    > Ensures that data is delivered reliably, in order, and without errors between applications over a network. It's like sending a tracked package that must arrive intact.

*   **User Datagram Protocol (UDP):**
    > A fast, lightweight protocol that sends messages without guaranteeing delivery or order. It's ideal for time-sensitive tasks like video streaming or online gaming, where speed is more important than perfect accuracy.

*   **Internet Protocol (IP):**
    > Responsible for addressing and routing packets of data so they can travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination. It's like the postal address on a letter.

*   **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP):**
    > The standard protocol for sending emails from an email client to an email server. It's the postman that picks up and sends your mail.

*   **Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3):**
    > A protocol used by email clients to download emails from a server to a single computer. Once downloaded, the emails are typically deleted from the server.

*   **Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP):**
    > A protocol that allows email clients to access and manage emails directly on the email server. This means you can access your email from multiple devices, and your actions are synchronized.

*   **Domain Name System (DNS):**
    > Translates human-readable domain names (like `www.google.com`) into machine-readable IP addresses (like `172.217.16.196`). It's the phonebook of the internet.

## Security Protocols

*   **Transport Layer Security (TLS) / Secure Sockets Layer (SSL):**
    > SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are security protocols that encrypt internet communication to protect data privacy and integrity. While the terms are often used interchangeably, TLS is the modern, more secure successor to SSL, which contains known vulnerabilities.

*   **Secure Shell (SSH):**
    > Cryptographic security protocol that secures operation of network services over an unsecured network.

*   **Internet Protocol Security (IPsec):**
    > Powerful set of rules to secure communication directly between two computers.

*   **Kerberos:**
    > Authentication protocol that works on basis of tickets to allow nodes communicating over an unsecure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner.

*   **Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) / Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, WPA3):**
    > Security protocols to secure wireless networks. WEP is obsolete and WPA3 is the current standard.

## Network Protocols

*   **Network Time Protocol (NTP):** 
    > A networking protocol for synchronizing computer clocks over a network. It ensures devices have accurate and consistent time, which is critical for logging, security services, and the validity of digital certificates. NTP operates at the application layer.
