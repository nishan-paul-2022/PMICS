# COBIT 5 Overview

COBIT 5 is a comprehensive framework for governing and managing enterprise IT, with a strong focus on IT security, risk management, and information security. Since information security often involves IT activities, COBIT 5 helps define what effective information security should look like in an organization.

COBIT 5 for Information Security extends the main COBIT 5 framework by providing detailed, practical guidance specifically for information security professionals and stakeholders.

## COBIT 5 Principles

### Principle 1: Meeting Stakeholder Needs

Organizations create value for stakeholders by balancing benefits, risks, and resource use. This ensures the company achieves its goals while managing potential downsides.

### Principle 2: Covering the Enterprise End-to-End

COBIT 5 integrates IT governance into overall enterprise governance. It covers all functions and processes in the organization, not just the IT department. Information and technology are treated as valuable assets that everyone in the company must manage, just like any other business asset.

### Principle 3: Applying a Single, Integrated Framework

There are many IT standards and best practices, each covering specific areas. COBIT 5 aligns with other frameworks like the ISO 27000 series, providing a unified approach to IT and information security activities.

### Principle 4: Enabling a Holistic Approach

Effective IT governance requires considering all interconnected components. COBIT 5 defines "enablers" as anything that helps achieve business objectives. These include:

- Principles, policies, and frameworks
- Processes
- Organizational structures
- Culture, ethics, and behavior
- Information
- Services, infrastructure, and applications
- People, skills, and competencies

### Principle 5: Separating Governance from Management

COBIT 5 clearly distinguishes between governance and management:

- **Management** (typically led by senior executives like the CEO) plans, builds, runs, and monitors IT activities to align with governance direction and achieve business goals.
- **Governance** (usually the responsibility of the board of directors) evaluates stakeholder needs, sets priorities, makes decisions, and monitors performance and compliance. Specific duties may be delegated to appropriate organizational structures.
