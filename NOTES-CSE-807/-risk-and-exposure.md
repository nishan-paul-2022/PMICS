## Risk and Exposure

### What is Exposure?
Exposure means how much a vulnerability is open to a threat, and this affects the risk level because more exposure increases the chance of being attacked. It's also called the attack surface. The amount of exposure depends on how well security controls work and where a device is placed in the network.

### What is Risk?
Risk is the mix of how likely something bad will happen and what the effects will be. The likelihood comes from how probable it is that a threat will take advantage of a weakness. If there's no harm or impact, there's no real risk. On the other hand, the worse the harm or impact, the higher the risk.
