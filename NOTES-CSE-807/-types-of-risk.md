# Types of Risk

## Inherent Risk

This is the natural risk in a business activity if there are no safety measures or controls in place. It's like how likely a big mistake could happen without any checks. The more people and business processes involved, the higher this risk gets.

## Residual Risk

This is the risk that stays after you add controls to reduce the original risk. Think of it as: Residual Risk = Inherent Risk - Controls. It's the leftover danger that controls don't fully eliminate.

## Detection Risk

This happens when auditors (people who check financial records) miss finding a big error in the company's financial statements. It's the chance they don't spot something important.

## Control Risk

This is the risk that a mistake could happen in the company's records, but the internal systems (like checks and balances) fail to catch or fix it. It's about the company's own controls not working properly.
