# The Cyber Kill Chain: A Step-by-Step Guide to Understanding Cyberattacks

The "Cyber Kill Chain" is a framework developed by Lockheed Martin that outlines the stages of a cyberattack. It provides a structured way to understand how attackers operate, helping security professionals to better defend against advanced persistent threats (APTs).

## The 7 Stages of the Cyber Kill Chain

The model is broken down into the following seven sequential phases:

1.  **Reconnaissance:**
    *   **Description:** This is the initial intelligence-gathering phase where an attacker researches the target to identify vulnerabilities, understand the network infrastructure, and find potential entry points.

2.  **Weaponization:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker creates a malicious payload, such as a virus, worm, or ransomware, designed to exploit the vulnerabilities discovered during reconnaissance. This payload is often hidden within a seemingly harmless file, like a PDF or Word document.

3.  **Delivery:**
    *   **Description:** The weaponized payload is transmitted to the target. Common delivery methods include email attachments, malicious links, or infected USB drives.

4.  **Exploitation:**
    *   **Description:** The malicious code is triggered when the victim interacts with the payload (e.g., opens an infected file or clicks a malicious link). This allows the attacker's code to execute on the target system.

5.  **Installation:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker installs malware on the compromised system to establish a persistent foothold. This ensures they can maintain access even if the system is rebooted.

6.  **Command & Control (C2):**
    *   **Description:** The malware opens a communication channel back to the attacker, allowing for remote control of the compromised system. This enables the attacker to send commands and exfiltrate data.

7.  **Actions on Objectives:**
    *   **Description:** In the final stage, the attacker carries out their ultimate goal, which could be anything from data theft and system disruption to financial fraud or espionage.

## Breaking the Chain

By understanding each stage of the Cyber Kill Chain, defenders can implement targeted security measures to interrupt the attack sequence. The goal is to "break the chain" at any point, preventing the attacker from reaching their final objective.
