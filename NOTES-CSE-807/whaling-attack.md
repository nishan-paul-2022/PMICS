A whaling attack is a sophisticated form of phishing that specifically targets high-profile individuals, such as CEOs, CFOs, celebrities, or other high-value targets ("whales") within an organization. Unlike generic phishing campaigns that cast a wide net, whaling involves extensive research to personalize the attack, making it more convincing and harder to detect. Attackers often pose as trusted entities (e.g., colleagues, vendors, or government officials) via email, phone, or social media, aiming to extract sensitive information, financial details, or access credentials.

Key characteristics:
- **Personalization**: Uses detailed knowledge about the target's role, relationships, and habits to craft believable messages.
- **Social Engineering**: Leverages urgency, authority, or emotional manipulation to prompt quick action, such as wire transfers or data disclosure.
- **High Impact**: Can result in significant financial loss, data breaches, or reputational damage due to the target's authority level.
- **Examples**: Fake executive requests for fund transfers or urgent contract approvals.

Prevention involves employee training, multi-factor authentication, email filtering, and verification protocols for high-risk communications. This contrasts with regular phishing (mass targeting) and spear-phishing (targeted but not necessarily high-value individuals).
