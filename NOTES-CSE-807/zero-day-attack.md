A zero-day attack is an exploit that targets a software vulnerability unknown to the vendor or developer, giving them "zero days" to create a fix before the attack occurs. These attacks are particularly dangerous because no patch or defense mechanism exists at the time of exploitation.

Key characteristics:
- **Zero-Day Vulnerability**: A flaw in software, hardware, or firmware that hasn't been publicly disclosed or patched.
- **Zero-Day Exploit**: The code or technique used to take advantage of the vulnerability.
- **Attack Execution**: Attackers can deploy malware, gain unauthorized access, steal data, or cause system compromise without detection by standard security tools.

Examples include exploits in operating systems, web browsers, or applications like the WannaCry ransomware, which leveraged a zero-day in Windows SMB protocol.

Prevention strategies:
- Regular software updates and patch management.
- Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS).
- Endpoint protection platforms (EPP).
- Threat intelligence sharing to identify emerging vulnerabilities.
- Network segmentation and least-privilege access to limit damage.

Zero-day attacks are often used by nation-state actors, cybercriminals, and hacktivists due to their stealth and effectiveness.
