### **R9.**

In our **rdt protocols**, why did we need to introduce **sequence numbers**?

---

### **R10.**

In our **rdt protocols**, why did we need to introduce **timers**?

---

### **R11.**

Suppose that the roundtrip delay between sender and receiver is constant and known to the sender. Would a timer still be necessary in protocol **rdt 3.0**, assuming that packets can be lost? Explain.

---

### **R12.**

Visit the **Go-Back-N interactive animation** at the companion Web site.

a. Have the source send five packets, and then pause the animation before any of the five packets reach the destination. Then kill the first packet and resume the animation. Describe what happens.
b. Repeat the experiment, but now let the first packet reach the destination and kill the first acknowledgment. Describe again what happens.
c. Finally, try sending six packets. What happens?

### **R13.**

Repeat **R12**, but now with the **Selective Repeat interactive animation**.
How are **Selective Repeat** and **Go-Back-N** different?
